# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements across all project roles and functions. See [OctoAcme Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for complete role descriptions.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

Consider perspectives from all cross-functional roles:
- Development and code quality
- Product direction and feature clarity
- Project coordination and communication
- QA and testing effectiveness
- UX and accessibility
- Security and compliance
- Infrastructure and deployment
- Customer support and feedback loops

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Invite all relevant cross-functional roles (PM, PdM, Developers, QA, UX, Security, DevOps, Support as applicable)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
